A simple C++ project for testing very primitive trigonometric functions for basic computer graphics

## Overview

I am building a very basic C++ application. The intent behind this project is primarily educational and exploratory. Here are some details:

- **Framework**: I'm using the [SDL (Simple DirectMedia Layer)](https://www.libsdl.org/) framework to aid in my 2D graphics work.
  
- **Target Platform**: This app is specifically being designed for **macOS on Apple Silicon**. As such, it might leverage some unique features of this architecture or have specific optimizations.
  
- **Development Environment**: All development is being carried out in **xCode**, Apple's integrated development environment (IDE).
  
- **Purpose**: My primary goal is to test the manipulation of 2D graphics using goniometric (trigonometric) functions. This is my sandbox where I'll be experimenting, tweaking, and learning.

- **Why C++?**: I could have chosen any language for this endeavor, but I decided to challenge myself with C++. I believe it's a great way to get deeper into both the language and the intricacies of graphics programming.

This project is purely personal, and I am sharing this information to provide context and share my learning journey. I hope you find it intriguing!
